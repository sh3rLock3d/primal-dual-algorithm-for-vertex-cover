# primal-dual algorithm for vertex cover

The basic idea of the algorithm in this repo is that instead of actually solving the dual LP, we can construct a feasible dual solution with the same properties. In this case, constructing the dual solution is much faster than solving the dual LP, and hence leads to a much faster algorithm.


the code is explained in the jupyter notebook available in this repo
